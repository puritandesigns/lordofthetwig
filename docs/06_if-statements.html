<h2>If Statement</h2>

<p>If the statement resolves or amounts to something true, do what comes after:</p>

<pre><code>
{% set truthy = true %}
{% set falsey = false %}

{% if truthy %}
    You'll see this.
{% endif %}

{% if falsey %}
    You won't see this.
{% endif %}

</code></pre>


<div class="well">
    You'll see this.

</div>

<h3>Truthy and Falsey Cautions</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 = true (or any number > 0)</li>
    <li>0 = false</li>
    <li>null = false</li>
    <li>Empty strings ('' or "") = false</li>
    <li>Non-empty strings ('something' or '&nbsp;&nbsp;') = true</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>
{% set location = 'shire' %}

{% if location == 'shire' %}
    In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.
    Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell,
    nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat:
    it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.
{% endif %} {% if location == 'rivendell' %}
    [Rivendell] was perfect whether you liked food, or sleep, or work, or story-telling,
    or singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them all.
    Evil things did not come into that valley.
{% endif %}

</code></pre>


<div class="well">
    In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.
    Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell,
    nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat:
    it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.
 </div>

<h3>Switch location and go through the same code</h3>
<pre><code>
{% set location = 'rivendell' %}

</code></pre>


<div class="well">
     [Rivendell] was perfect whether you liked food, or sleep, or work, or story-telling,
    or singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them all.
    Evil things did not come into that valley.
</div>

<h2>Else and elseif Statement</h2>

<p>Using elseif allows to add other checks to the code block</p>
<p>
    Using else is a catch all.
    If none of the previous statements amount to true,
    then do what's in the else block.
</p>

<p>
    We can rewrite the above code and use an elseif statement:
</p>

<pre><code>
{% if location == 'shire' %}
    In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.
    Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell,
    nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat:
    it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.
{% elseif location == 'rivendell' %}
    [Rivendell] was perfect whether you liked food, or sleep, or work, or story-telling,
    or singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them all.
    Evil things did not come into that valley.
{% endif %}

</code></pre>

<div class="well">
    [Rivendell] was perfect whether you liked food, or sleep, or work, or story-telling,
    or singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them all.
    Evil things did not come into that valley.
</div>

<p>But if the fellowship is somewhere else, we can catch that with "else":</p>

<pre><code>
{% set location = 'moria' %}

{% if location == 'shire' %}
    In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.
    Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell,
    nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat:
    it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.
{% elseif location == 'rivendell' %}
    [Rivendell] was perfect whether you liked food, or sleep, or work, or story-telling,
    or singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them all.
    Evil things did not come into that valley.
{% else %}
    All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost...
{% endif %}

</code></pre>


<div class="well">
    All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost...
</div>

<h2>Other if checks</h2>
<p>You don't need to always use "==" in if statements. Here's others:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>
        <h3>Signs: <, >, <=, =></h3>
        Use greater/lesser than or greater/lesser than or equal to:<br>
<pre><code>
{% if location == 'weathertop' %}
    {% set ring_wraiths = 5 %}
    {% if ring_wraiths < 6 %}
        Frodo will escape to Rivendell
    {% else %}
        Frodo will be captured
    {% endif %}
{% endif %}

</code></pre>
        or
<pre><code>
{% if location == 'weathertop' %}
    {% set ring_wraiths = 5 %}
    {% if ring_wraiths <= 5 %}
        Frodo will escape to Rivendell
    {% else %}
        Frodo will be captured
    {% endif %}
{% endif %}

</code></pre>

        <div class="well">
                                        Frodo will escape to Rivendell
                    </div>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>Not equal: != or not</h3>
        <p>You can negate a check:</p>
<pre><code>
{% if location != 'shire' %}Far from home{% endif %}

{% if ring_wraiths != 9 %}Not all are accounted for{% endif %}

{% if not truthy %}
    Since truthy is true and the not makes it false, this won't show.
{% else %}
    So we need an else statement to show something.
{% endif %}

{% if not falsey %}Negated falsey makes it true!{% endif %}

</code></pre>

<div class="well">
    Far from home    <br>
    Not all are accounted for    <br>
            So we need an else statement to show something.
        <br>
    Negated falsey makes it true!    <br>
</div>
    </li>
</ul>
